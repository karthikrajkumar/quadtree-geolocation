## Documentation

- **Summary:** Web application

### Sections

#### Item 1

- **Title:** Executive Summary

- **Body:** Web application

Repository: /tmp/a2a-repo-kNNDJb
Generated from repository analysis using static code patterns and inferred semantics.

#### Item 2

- **Title:** Actors

- **Body:** No explicit actor evidence found.

- **Title:** Business Capabilities

- **Body:** No business-level capabilities could be inferred with confidence.

#### Item 4

- **Title:** Functional Workflows

- **Body:** ### Primary Application Flow
Users interact with the application through defined entry points. The system processes requests through service layers and persists state according to domain rules.

#### Item 5

- **Title:** Business Rules

- **Body:** - Business rules could not be fully inferred from static analysis; runtime validation and documentation review are recommended.

#### Item 6

- **Title:** System Interactions

- **Body:** The platform coordinates user-facing features through API and component layers. Inferred interaction patterns follow standard web application design with frontend-to-service communication.

#### Item 7

- **Title:** Assumptions and Open Questions

- **Body:** - Static analysis infers intent from naming patterns and structural evidence; runtime behavior may differ.
- Some routes or API-like constructs may originate from frontend navigation rather than backend services.
- Actor roles are inferred from evidence and may not capture all possible system users.
- Business capabilities are derived from keywords and patterns; manual review is recommended to validate domain accuracy.
- The precise business domain is unclear from analysis; consider manual review to confirm system purpose.

- **Notes:** No endpoint catalog confidently inferred from frontend-only evidence

#### Code Quality Observations

_No entries found._

#### Missing Or Weak Areas

##### Item 1

- **Issue:** Service layer pattern not clearly detected

- **Why It Matters:** Without service orchestration boundaries, business logic may be scattered and harder to govern.

- **Confidence:** medium

- **Suggested Next Refinement:** Improve role inference for domain-specific orchestrator files and facades.

##### Item 2

- **Issue:** Routing/navigation structure not clearly detected

- **Why It Matters:** Navigation control points are critical for feature boundaries and UX flow analysis.

- **Confidence:** medium

- **Suggested Next Refinement:** Expand routing detection to framework-specific route registration styles.

##### Item 3

- **Issue:** Domain model layer is weak or not explicit

- **Why It Matters:** Weak domain representation reduces confidence in business-architecture mapping.

- **Confidence:** medium

- **Suggested Next Refinement:** Expand model detection to include view-model/state interfaces and schema objects.

#### Confidence Notes

- **Overall:** low

##### Evidence Coverage

- **Files Analyzed:** 0

- **Key Modules:** 0

- **Hotspots:** 0

- **Api Signals:** 0

#### Missing Or Weak Areas

##### Item 1

- **Issue:** No high-confidence runtime flows could be inferred

- **Why It Matters:** Cannot reconstruct reliable user journeys; behavioral documentation will be speculative

###### Affected Flows

_No entries found._

- **Confidence:** high

- **Suggested Next Refinement:** Verify app.routes.ts exists and component files follow Angular naming conventions (*.component.ts, *.page.ts)

##### Item 2

- **Issue:** No Angular route file found (app.routes.ts / app-routing.module.ts)

- **Why It Matters:** Route→component mapping is not confirmed — all entry points are inferred from file names only

###### Affected Flows

_No entries found._

- **Confidence:** high

- **Suggested Next Refinement:** Locate routing module — check NgModule imports or look for standalone bootstrapApplication() with routes array

#### Remediation Notes

##### Item 1

- **Reason:** Route file not found — flow entry points inferred from file naming only, not from actual route configuration

###### Files To Inspect

- app.routes.ts
- app-routing.module.ts

- **Issue Type:** analysis-gap

##### Item 2

- **Reason:** No test files found — runtime behavior cannot be validated against test assertions or mocked service expectations

###### Files To Inspect

_No entries found._

- **Issue Type:** missing-tests

#### Confidence Notes

- 0 total flows inferred (0 high / 0 medium / 0 low confidence)
- Backend repo: flows inferred from controller→service→repository import chains
- Route-confirmed entry points: 0 of 0
- Service methods confirmed: 0 of 0 flows
- No domain workflow state transitions found
- No meaningful exception handling patterns detected
